# Hogwarts-Letter-React
Coding challenge during my time at Launch Academy

The goal of this project was given existing React code, account for a user clicking a selector to change what should be rendered on the page.

The logic is done on the top level React component which accounts for a change in state and renders an assigned variable representing different React components based on the current state for an item being "clicked".
